# filament_annotator_3D

Annotation of filament structures in 3D based on napari viewer

### Annotation instructions:

1. Rotate the image to find a position, where the filament is clearly visible
2. Draw a line over the filament, by holding "Control" and dragging the mouse
3. Rotate the image to view the filament from another angle and repeat step 2
4. Rotate the image again: this will trigger calculating the filament position
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for other filaments
